# Online Art Gallery Documentation

Our idea is for an Online art gallery where artists and art enthusiasts can gather to show off their work, gain some attention towards it, and share their opinions with other like-minded people. This web application will attempt to help talented artists, no matter their circumstances, to get some publicity for their hard work. I believe this type of website will also have a number of transferable skills for common web development projects e.g. blogs, portfolio sites, etc.

## This App will be used by:

### Artists:

- Can upload their artworks to be displayed
  - can add a title,
  - description/artist-statement,
  - genre,
  - medium
- Can create an artist profile with information about themself and their practice
- Can add comments on other peoples art

### Art-lovers:

- Can view Artwork uploaded by Artists
  - Sort by categories such as art-genre, medium, etc
- Can comment on pieces of art

### Admins:

- Can delete artworks not suitable for the website
- Can delete Artist accounts not suitable for the website
- Can delete comments not suitable for the website
