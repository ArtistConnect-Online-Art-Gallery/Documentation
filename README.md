# Online Art Gallery Documentation

## The problem:

The problem we are aiming to solve with this website is the difficulty for new and experienced artists to gather attention towards their artworks and meet people with a similar or compatible taste in art.

## The solution/purpose:

Our idea is for an Online art gallery where artists and art enthusiasts can gather to show off their work, gain some attention towards it, and share their opinions with other like-minded people. This web application will attempt to help talented artists, no matter their circumstances, to get some publicity for their hard work. The site will also serve as a supportive place for new artists to show off their artistic projects and learn, gather inspiration from, and connect with others working in similar mediums. We believe this type of website will also have a number of transferable skills for common web development projects e.g. blogs, portfolio sites, etc.
